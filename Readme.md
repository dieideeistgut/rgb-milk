# RGB-Milk
#### ionic frontend talking to rgp-pi server

This little thingy sends commands to a [rgb-pi](https://github.com/ryupold/rgb-pi) server. The screenshot should be clear:

Everything is buggy and alpha. IOS Build runs though - just not sending commands because i
think i didn't use Angular calls but jQuery ones. Yes that's cheap n buggy but makes me
able to use it locally on my raspberry to control my lightbars for the moment.

Will be fixed.

Please don't sue me for my cheap JS code. It's my first ionic project. Thanks.
